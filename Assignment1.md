## Data Reporting Critique

### CLARITY AND ACCURACY - 5

#### Central Insight (5)
I read Josh Kaplan’s 2020 DCist [investigation into the Washington D.C. eviction process][1]. The central insight is that a large share of the eviction summonses required by law were not actually delivered. Because tenants do not receive the summonses in a timely fashion, they miss opportunities to fight their evictions. Further, the city’s primary process server (i.e. the company that delivers summonses on behalf of landlords) has an extensive history of fraud. 

This insight was hinted in the headline, but DCist posed the idea as a question: “Thousands Of D.C. Renters Are Evicted Every Year. Do They All Know To Show Up To Court?”

Kaplan communicated much of the insight early in the lengthy article, though the message becomes stronger as the article goes on. His use of an anecdote at the beginning was a great device for explaining the larger issue.

#### Data Viz (5)
The article had one data visualization – a time-lapse map of alleged summons deliveries. It was embedded as a YouTube video, so there was limited interactivity.

That said, it didn’t need any more interactivity. It was easy to understand the iconography with the clock in the top left corner. My only suggestion is to place it earlier in the article. This piece was quite long, so engaging the reader with a data visualization might have helped reader retention.

#### Data Accuracy (5)
Perhaps I’m not using a critical enough lens, but I see little reason to question the data. Kaplan communicated his sources (court documents) and seemed to consult legal experts throughout the reporting process. I did not think there was anything missing explanation.

My only critique is that he did not explain his process for obtaining the court records and reviewing each case. Some more proactive transparency about his analysis process could help to dispel doubters.

### OVERALL QUALITY (4)
Kaplan did truly excellent work here, in my opinion. He explained the eviction process well. His writing was consistently clear and easy to follow. He mixed in lots of anecdotes and statements from experts to keep the piece, despite its length, engaging and interesting. His analysis was clear and yielded immediate action from the city council.

But – and I lament this being the case – the article was far too long. Also, the multimedia elements were sometimes mediocre. 

I think Kaplan and his editors should have broken this up into a series of articles or shortened this one. His central insight grew stronger and stronger, but it did not change much after the first 20% or so of the story. If I weren’t reading this for class, I’m not sure I would have made it to the end. 

Also, for such a data-rich story, it was shocking to only see one graphic. Another graphic or two on evictions would have helped show the extent of DC’s eviction crisis in a more concise package than paragraphs of text. Additionally, the photographs of buildings are nice breaks from the text but are not all that engaging. 

### TYPE AND COLOR – 5
There is only one graphic in the story. I give it top marks on both type and color. I liked that the limited textual information was presented in a large, sans-serif font. The color of the most relevant element – the house icons – was easy to see.

### CREATIVITY – 3
The map was a helpful and creative illustration of the processor server’s fraud, and the story was not weighed down with unnecessary graphics. But some of the photos were not engaging and the author did a poor job of using data to visually show the extent of the evictions issue in DC.

## Story Pitch

### Which states and cities around the country would have declining populations if not for the influx of immigrants? 

Republicans like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott have tried to center immigration as a key issue in the 2022 midterms. Demographic and cultural change is uncomfortable for some Americans, but in some areas of the country, immigration may be crucial to the continued growth of local economies.

The US Census Bureau tracks native-born and foreign-born population across the country. You could visually represent the population changes with and without immigrations using maps.

Sources for this story could include:
+	Politicians and community leaders in cities that would be shrinking if not immigration,
+	Immigrants to such places,
+	Labor economists and sociologists who study demographic changes

This idea comes from a project I did about Harrisonburg, VA several years ago. Harrisonburg is a slowly growing college town in central Virginia that (as of 2018) would be shrinking if not for immigrants.
