# Part 2: What’s been done already on the topic of immigrant-dependent population growth in the US?


There are many cities and states that rely on foreign immigration for growth, and there is easily available research on that topic. The NY Times published a [good national overview][1] on the topic in 2019. New American Economy (NAE), a group focused on promoting immigration, published [research in 2019][2] identifying 12 metro areas that grew but would have shrunk if not for immigration. NAE published additional [research in 2020][3] identifying states that most heavily depend on immigration to maintain population and/or workforce growth. Pew published [county-level research][4] in 2019, too.

Given existing coverage of the topic, I doubt I could produce any kind of new national insight. If I want to stay on this topic/question, it probably makes the most sense to approach this from a state or local lens. 

I have not found robust state and local coverage, but my search has admittedly been limited by paywalls for publications and unfamiliarity with the slate of local news outlets in some places. The only article from a nearby state I was able to find was in the Virginia Mercury. They published a [brief bulletin][5] on this topic in 2019, based on the Pew research.

My current plan is to cover one state only (perhaps West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or Maryland). I can create a map showing immigration-dependent growth in the state’s largest metro areas and find a particularly striking case-in-point.



# Part 3: High quality datasets I could use:

1. US Census Bureau 1-Year Estimates from the American Community Survey. This dataset has many helpful data fields at convenient 1-year intervals. Perhaps the most relevant fields are US-born population and native population. I’ve already done a quick analysis of the biggest metropolitan statistical areas in western PA. I trust this data because it’s the Census – the gold standard!!
  
1. The data used for [Pew’s 2019 map][6] is available as a Tableau workbook, which I’ve downloaded. The data come from the Census bureau (so I trust it), but the analysis/spreadsheet itself is a helpful tool that may save me the work of gathering data myself.

1. The [American Immigrant Council][7] has a map evaluating the economic impact of immigrants in states, metropolitan areas and counties around the country. They mostly rely on Census data, but they also pulled in data from the State Department, NAFSA and the Congressional Budget Office. I’m somewhat wary of their analysis, given their apparent policy position(s) on immigration. But I do trust their data sources. Also, one big limitation: The underlying data is not immediately available from their website.
