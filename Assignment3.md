# Short Memo on Data Reliability for Final Project

Quite frankly, I'm not terribly worried about bad data issues for my project since I anticipate that I will mostly be working with US Census data. That said, here are the main potential issues that spring to mind:

### Small sample sizes. Can I trust Census estimates for data fields related to immigration in small, rural places?


One way to interrogate the data is to become familiar with a given area by reading news articles and finding other information to see if data from the Census pass the smell test.


### FIPS codes. Will I make the cardinal sin of converting them to numbers by accident?


No. I will not.


### Untrustworthy authors. How much should I trust data and analysis from think tanks that focus on immigration, like the American Immigration Council?

The AIC says on its website that it is "highly respected for its willingness and ability to bring cutting-edge lawsuits that hold the government accountable." So, of course I trust them!

When I use data and analysis from them, or other think-tanks/potentially biased groups, I will snoop around for evaluations of their reliability. For example, [Media Bias / Fact Check (MBFC)][1] rates the American Immigration Council as biased in its language but reliable in its "factual reporting due to the strong sourcing of information and a clean fact check record."'
